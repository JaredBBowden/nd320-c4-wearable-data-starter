        "# Exercise 3: PPG SNR\n",
        "\n",
        "A useful task for evaluating PPG signals is computing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The SNR of a signal is a measure of how noisy the signal. High SNRs mean that the signal has very little noise. Often times, calculating the SNR is more of an art than a science because very often, we don't know which parts of the signal are noise and which are not.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you have a PPG signal with a contemporaneous reference pulse rate, you can use that pulse rate to approximate the SNR of the PPG signal. Ideally, most of the energy in the Fourier transform of the signal should be concentrated around the pulse rate frequency (and any harmonics of that frequency). So one measure of SNR would be the ratio of energy around the pulse rate frequency (and harmonics) to the amount of energy elsewhere.\n",
